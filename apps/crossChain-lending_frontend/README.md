# Lending UI

This repo runs using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Install the dependencies.

At the root directory of this monorepo, run `npm install` (this is where `turbo.json` is located for example). If you have done that previously, skip this section.

## Run the UI

First, make sure to deploy the contract in the `lending-contract` app. The readme there explains how to do it.

Then run:

`npm run dev`
